        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Namaste!

          Four years of studying architecture have taught me that buildings are more than just shelterâ€”they shape our experiences and interactions. I am particularly drawn to designing structures where walls and coverings serve more than just functional barriers; they enhance both spatial quality and environmental harmony. My passion lies in creating energy-efficient buildings that promote the well-being of both people and the planet.
            
            In this collection, I have included brief descriptions of projects that I enjoyed working on and that have significantly contributed to my learning journey. This is just a glimpse of my growth as a designer, and I look forward to expanding my knowledge even further through the upcoming internship program.
